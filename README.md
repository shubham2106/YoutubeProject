# YoutubeProject
This is a project to fetch latest videos from youtube.

Description - Here I am fetching YT's latest video for a specific keyword/string and storing it in mongoDB. 
Then I have created 3 api's - 
1. To get all the videos in paginated way.
2. To get all the videos with any specific title/description.
3. To add a new api key to the array. 

**command - npm start**
